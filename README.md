# Blockchain Electoral System
Voting Blockchain is an online Blockchain system that is designed with the sole purpose of voting. The Blockchain system allows users to create an election, set the amount of money they will spend on the election, the date and time of the election and the end time for the election. It also allows users to upload two csv files, one for all the contenders in an election, the other for all the people allowed to vote in the election. Once an election has been created by the various parties all the people taking part in the election receive a link on their emails that allows them to vote. All the votes go to a commission pool whereby miners can validate these votes and in the process are rewarded with the crypto currency called the AEON currency.
